- Paid Time Off can be taken in either half or full days. 5 days can be rolled over to the next calendar year

- 20 days per year until 10 years of service

- 23 days per year from 10 to 19 years of service

- 25 days per year after 20 years of service

- Holiday calendar is taken from the [NYSE trading holiday calendar](https://www.nyse.com/markets/hours-calendars)

- Guaranteed 11 paid holiday days per year, when there are fewer than 11 non-trading days in the NYSE calendar they are added to that year's leave balance

- Unlimited sick leave, policy states that on the fourth consecutive sick day you must contact the disability administrator (external company) to see if you should switch to short term disability or some other family/medical leave

## üè¢ Cisco

_Last updated: May 2022._

- 20 days of base PTO per year regardless of tenure. Employees are generally forced to take 4-6 of these days during the annual company "shutdown" between Christmas and New Years, however.
- 1 "floating holiday" (nearly indistinguishable from PTO but does not accrue in the same way)
- 10 "Time2Give" days to do volunteer work etc.
- 1 day off for your birthday
- "Emergency Time Off" - to be used for serious illness, bereavement, family emergencies, etc. - is separate from standard PTO and does not have an explicit limit
- 11 standard company holidays + (as of 2022) 4 additional scheduled days off ("days for me")

## üè¢ Discord

_Last updated: May 2022._

- (16) paid holidays each year including a week off for winter holidays.
- (20) vacation days/PTO each year

Also includes 2 floating holidays

## üè¢ Facebook

_Last updated: May 2022._

You accrue 21 days/yr, capped at 31.5 days (both regardless of tenure)

There are also a bunch of PTO-related/adjacent benefits:

- 2 extra "Choice Days" per year, which are pretty much PTO days outside of the accrual process
- 5 "Meta Days" each year (company days off)
- you can use up to 10 days of PTO you haven't accrued yet
- every 5 years you can take a 30-day paid recharge leave

The first two were introduced during the pandemic and I'm not sure whether they'll last long-term, but that's this year's policy, at least.

"Unlimited" PTO[^unlimited]

## üè¢ Kickstarter

_Last updated: May 2022._

Approx. 100 employees.

Normally, the vacation policy reads:

Full-time employees may accrue up to twenty-one (21) days (168 hours) of paid vacation/PTO per year.  Vacation/PTO days are accrued on a monthly basis at a rate of 1.75 days (12 hours) per month.  Part-time employees may accrue vacation/PTO at a rate of two (2) hours for every thirty (30) hours worked.

Kickstarter is presently doing a 4 day work week pilot, during this pilot, the PTO accrual schedule has changed it's text to:

All full-time Kickstarter staff are encouraged to enjoy our PTO / Vacation policy ("PTO" or "Vacation") to travel, pursue personal projects, rest, and relax. We encourage every member of the team to take 16 days of vacation each calendar year. Vacation days are accrued on a monthly basis at a rate of 1.33 days per month.

Because the pilot started during Q2 2022, this year we have 17 days of PTO total.

Additionally, there is a winter break (office closure) during the last week of December.

Vacation days do not roll over from year to year and employees are not eligible to be compensated for unused vacation days upon separation from Kickstarter (unless required by local/state law).
